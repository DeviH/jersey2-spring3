Scrum is an iterative approach to Agile software development. The methodology has been around since the 1980s but was popularised by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber. 

Scrum breaks the development of a product down in to discrete iterations (termed Sprints) that each deliver functionality that could potentially be shipped to users.

The Scrum Alliance offers an excellent [introduction to Scrum|http://www.scrumalliance.org/resources/47] that provides an overview of key Scrum concepts, stakeholders, processes and artefacts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i002jz:",,,,,,,AGILE Sprint 4,2.0,,,,,,,,,,

Scrum teams do not normally apply story point estimates to bugs because bugs are considered to be part of the ongoing work that the team must deal with (i.e the overhead). If you view the story points completed in a sprint as a measure of progress, then bugs also have no value because they do not deliver anything additional to the customer. 

However, you can apply estimates to bugs if you wish by configuring the ""Story Points"" field to apply to other Issue Types (by default it only applies to Stories and Epics).

Try updating the Story Point estimate to 4 by clicking on the ""Estimate"" then typing.

*Estimating using Story Points*

Because the traditional process of estimating tasks in weeks or days is often wildly inaccurate, many Scrum teams estimate in Story Points instead. Story Points exist merely as a way to estimate a task's difficulty compared to some other task (for example, a 10-point story would probably take double the effort of a 5-point story). As teams mature with Scrum they tend to achieve a consistent number of Story Points from Sprint to Sprint -- this is termed the team's _velocity_. This allows the Product Owner to use the velocity to predict how many Sprints it will take to deliver parts of the backlog. 

Many teams use Planning Poker to achieve consensus on Story Point estimates.

*Using Other Estimation Units*

You can configure JIRA Software to use time-based estimates if you wish. In the configuration for the board, on the ""Estimation"" tab, select ""Original Time Estimate"" as your Estimation Statistic. If you also wish to track the time used during the Sprint, select ""Remaining Estimate and Time Spent"" to enable Time Tracking in JIRA Software.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i002kn:",,,,,,,,5.0,,,,,,,,,,

*About User Stories*

The Scrum methodology drops traditional software requirement statements in favour of real world problems expressed as User Stories. Stories describe the task a particular user is trying to achieve and its value. They are typically of the form ""As a (role) I want (something) so that (benefit)"". This approach focuses the team on the core user need rather than on implementation details. 

Stories are ""placeholders for a conversation"" -- they do not need to be especially detailed since it is expected that the team will work together to resolve ambiguity as the story is developed. 

Stories to be implemented in the future are stored in the Product Backlog. The backlog is ranked by the Product Owner so that the next items to be completed are at the top.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i002k7:",,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,
